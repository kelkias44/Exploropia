<p style="color: darkred"> <b>What can you tell me about Ethiopia? </b>   </p>
<p>
<br>The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is a developing country located in the northeastern part of Africa
<br>commonly known as ' The Horn of Africa'. It lies in the equatorial region between 30 - 180 north and 330 - 480 east.
<br> Eritrea and Djibouti bound it on the northeast, on the east and southeast by Somalia, on the south by Kenya and
<br> on the west by Sudan and South Sudan. Ethiopia is as large as France and Spain combined, and has a landmass
<br>1,104,300 sq.km. It is the tenth largest country in Africa by size and second by population. It is a democratic
<br> national comprising of 11 semi-autonomous administrative regions organized loosely along major ethnic lines.
<br>It has an agriculturally dominated economy, which about 65 per cent of the land is presentl cultivated.
<br>Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa and has its own calendar, alphabet and clock.

        <p style="color: darkred"> <b>Is Ethiopia really the cradle of mankind?What can you tell me about Lucy'? </b> </p>
        <p>
 <br>Lucy is a 3.5 million years old female skeleton, and is among several important archaeological discoveries in
 <br>Ethiopia, leading to the country’s title as 'the cradle of mankind'. It is a complete direct hominid fossil discovered
 <br> in the northeast of Ethiopia at a place called Hadar. Visitors to the National Museum in Addis Ababa can view it on display.

                <p style="color: darkred"> <b>What can you tell me about the people of Ethiopia? </b> </p>
                <p>
  <br>Ethiopia is considered to be a mosaic of cultural diversity. 'The population of Ethiopia is estimated to be about
  <br> 80 million. It is the home of more than 80 ethnic groups. Based on the language they speak, they can be divided
  <br>into Semitic, Hamitic, Nilotic and Omotic origin. Despite their diversity, Ethiopians are characterized as peaceful
  <br>and hospitable, and united in their struggle to develop the country. Ethiopians, often called 'Habesha,' have a
  <br>common name for their visitors “Ferenji” which is not meant in disrespect, but in a friendly and sociable manner.
  <br>Ethiopians are proud of their culture and civilization, which pre-date those of Europe.

                        <p>
  <br>A wide variety of different dishes are available in Ethiopia and most of them are unique to the country so you have to
  <br> familiarize yourself first with the names of different dishes. You can choose from the spicy and hot Doro Wot, Kitfo,
  <br>or Key Wot to less spicy dishes like Alicha Wot. You can get these foods virtually anywhere in the country and portions
  <br>are generous and very inexpensive. There are also home made and fabricated local drinks for you to choose from Araki- a
  <br>strong alcoholic beverage made from millet and maize, Tej - a mead like drink made from honey and Tela - locally brewed
  <br>beer from maize, wheat and barely and Guder- the Ethiopian wine.

                                <p style="color: darkred"><b> What is the base of the Ethiopian economy? </b> </p>
                                <p>
  <br>Ethiopia's economy is predominantly agricultural. The highlands are very fertile, which contain many large rivers with
  <br>enormous untapped potential for irrigation projects. About 80 per cent of the population earns their living from the land,
  <br>mainly as subsistence farmers. Agriculture is the backbone of the national economy and the principal exports from this
  <br>sector are coffee, oil seeds, pulses, flowers, vegetables, sugar and foodstuffs for animals. There is also a thriving
  <br>livestock sector, exporting camel on the hoof and hides and skins. 25% of the population grow coffee and it accounts
  <br> for as much as 55% of Ethiopia's exports.

                                        <p>
  <br>A volcanically formed central plateau, isolated on three sides by low- lying desert dominates the Ethiopian landscape.
  <br>The central plateau, often referred to as the Ethiopian highlands, has an average altitude of above 2,000m and
  <br> includes 20 peaks of 4,000m or higher. The Ethiopia highlands are dramatically mountainous, no more so than
  <br>where they are bisected by the Rift Valley, which starts at the Red sea, then continues through the Danakil
  <br>Depression and through southern Ethiopia to Mozambique in southern Africa. The part of the Rift valley, south
  <br>of Addis Ababa, is notable for its string of eight lakes. The most extensive mountain ranges on the highlands
  <br>are the Semien, which lie directly north of Gondar, and Bale, which lies in the southern highlands to the east
  <br>of the Rift Valley. Mount Ras Dashen in the Semiens is 4,620m, the fourth highest peak in Africa. The highlands
  <br> also form the source of four major river systems. The best known of these is the Blue Nile or Abay, which
  <br>starts at Lake Tana in the northwest and supplies nine- tenths of the Nile's water, which eventually reaches
  <br> Egypt's Nile Valley.

                                                <p>
  <br>Ethiopia shows a wide climatic variation, ranging from the peaks of the Semien and Bale, which receive periodic snowfall,
  <br> to regular daytime temperatures of over 50 0C in the Danakil Depression. As a rule, the highland has a temperate climate
  <br> and average day time temperature of 160C. Due to their proximity to the Equator, the eastern lowlands and far south is
  <br>dry and hot. The western lowlands are moist and hot, making them one part of the country that feels truly tropical.
  <br>The southern rift valley, much of which is at the relatively high altitude of 1.500m, is temperate to hot and seasonally
  <br>moist. The general precipitation pattern is that the bulk of the rain in the highlands and Rift valley falls between
  <br>mid-June and early October. The rainy season in the Rift Valley generally starts and ends a few weeks earlier than in the
  <br>highlands. The northeastern highlands have a less reliable rainy season than other highland parts of Ethiopia. In normal
  <br>rainy season the highlands receive an average rainfall of 800 to 2,200mm. From a tourist's point of view, rain tends to
  <br>fall in dramatic storms, which end as suddenly as they start,a situation that is infinitely easier for travel in than
  <br>days of protracted drizzle.

        <p style="color: darkred"><b>What does thirteen months of sunshine mean?</b></p>
        <p>
<br>Ethiopia follows the Julian calendar, which consists of twelve months of thirty days each and a thirteenth month of five
<br>days (six days on leap year). You can see the sun every day of the year That is why we having the saying “13 months of
<br>sunshine”. You will be seven years younger when you arrive in Ethiopia because the calendar is seven years and eight
<br>months behind the western calendar.
