       <h3>History of Ethiopia </h3><hr>
  <p>
       <br><span style="color: darkcyan;"> <b>History</b></span><br>
        Ethiopia and its history is the story of Africa at its inception. Archeologists and anthropologists commonly count
        <br>Ethiopia as the origin of man. In 1994 the oldest human remains ever were discovered here. The 4.4 million old bones of
         <br>Homo Ramidus Afarensis, were found in Ethiopia's Afar region - the previous record was held by "Lucy" or "Dinkinish"
         <br>(Amharic for "wonderful"), who at 3.4 million yearswas a relative youngster. Ethiopia has extensive historic sites, particularly
         <br>in the north of the country, where the tourists can view buildings dating from the first millennium BC, the stelae and
         <br>tombs of the Axumite kings, rock hewn churches dating from the 4th century, the monasteries of Lake Tana and the 13th century
         <br> monolithic rock hewn churches of King Lalibela in Wollo. In the east, the 1000 year old city of Harrar, with its more than 99
         <br>mosques, is considered as the fourth holiest place in Islam, after Mecca, Median and Jerusalem. South of Addis Ababa there
         <br>are a number of Neolithic sites, including the 1.5-1.8 million year old site at Melka Kunture (Oromia Region) and the 400 stelae
         <br> at Dilla in Sidamo (Southern Region). Elsewhere in the southern region there are remote, medieval monasteries and in Jimma, in
         <br>Oromia, there is the recently restored palace of Abba Jiffar, the last independent king of the area.

         <span style="color: darkcyan;"><b>Country</b></span>
         <br>Ethiopia is a land of great variety, from the high peaks of the Semien Mountain in Amhara to the below sea-level Danakil Depression
         <br> in the Afar region, tropical forests, lakes, savannah and deserts. In Bale National Park in Oromia, home of many endemic mammals
         <br>and birds, visitors can see unique alpine fauna and flora, volcanic lakes and trout filled streams. For big game safaris,
         <br>there are the Omo and Mago National Parks in the Southern Region, with their fascinating Mursi and Hamer villages.

           <span style="color: darkcyan;"><b>Security</b></span>
         <br>Despite its location in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia is a very safe country to visit, and Addis Ababa is still one of the safest
         <br>capitals in Africa. There is little incidence of personal crimes such as assault and robbery, and the country’s security forces
         <br> have taken great measures to prevent terrorists from instigating violence that could arm the safety of residents and visitors and
         <br> disrupt the business community, which has registered 8 years of significant growth. Visitors should, of course, take the usual
         <br> precautions - not carry large amounts of money with them and leave particularly valuable items locked away. Both men and women
         <br>should be careful to keep handbags and personal property at hand in crowded places like Mercato. Like everywhere else, pickpockets
         <br>like to create some kind of diversion before making their move, so visitors should walk purposefully and be cautious about sudden
         <br>introductions in the street. In Addis Ababa, such incidents as do occur tend to happen in the city center, in a circle linking the
         <br> Ghion, Ethiopian and Ras Hotels.

      <p>
          <span style="color: darkcyan;"><b>Health and Precautions</b></span>
        <br>Ethiopia requires all visitors to have an up-to-date Yellow Fever vaccination certificate. Generally, for their own protection,
        <br>visitors should be immunized or have received a booster shot against hepatitis A and B, Tetanus, Typhoid and Polio. In regard to
        <br>malaria, visitors on the Historic Route (Axum, Gondar, Bahar Dar and Lalibela) need not worry about malaria, but should bring insect
        <br>repellent cream, gel or spray for mosquitoes.<br>

       <br> The area of Ethiopia directly to the south of Addis Ababa is also considered a malaria free zone. Before your trip, please consult
       <br>online malaria zone maps which are made available by the US Center for Disease Control and the FitForTravel.com website in the UK.
       <br>Chloroquine is not effective against malariain Ethiopia.
       <br>For visitors sensitive to insect bites, it is advisable to bring antihistamine cream or tablets. Some old buildings and old churches
       <br> on the Historic Route are prone to flea infestation. It is worth carrying some antiseptic cream, for minor cuts. Anti-diarrhea tablets
       <br> (Imodium or Lomatil) should be carried as a precautionary measure - if you do have a stomach upset, it might be some distance to the
       <br>nearest toilet and either of these tablets is guaranteed to help.(These only address the symptoms rather than what caused them, so for
       <br>anything more serious than a stomach upset medical advice should be sought - there are government hospitals in most areas of tourist
       <br> interest.) The temperatures in the highlands (on the Historic Route) are moderate, rarely exceeding 30oC even at the hottest times of
       <br>the year. However, the sun is strong and visitors coming from cooler climates should get a high protection grade (15) UV barrier cream,
       <br>particularly for the face. For the arms and legs, a lower protection grade would be sufficient. With the dry weather, lip balms are
       <br>recommended. For visitors who make the boat trip on Lake Tana, or even some of the longer mule trips around Axum or Lalibela, hats should
       <br> be worn. All visitors are advised to take out standard holiday insurance covering health emergencies in their country of origin.
