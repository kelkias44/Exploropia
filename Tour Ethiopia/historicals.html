                <p>
            <br>Lalibela is famous for its amazing rock cut churches. Carved out of the rock rather than built with stone, each of these eleven churches has
            <br>been excavated from the rock, cutting down up to 40 feet then cutting out the intricate interior with great care.

            <br>Access to the buildings is down a rocky staircase. Once down, the Lalibela churches are linked by a series of tunnels and walkways.

                <p>
            <br>The Yeha Temple, also known as the Great Temple of Yeha, is possibly the oldest standing building in Ethiopia, dating back, it is thought, to around 700 BC. 

            <br> It harks back to the earliest religions of the area and contains some Judaic artefacts, perhaps giving some credence to claim of the early dynasty of their 
            <br>descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Other places of interest at Yeha include a burial ground and ruined buildings containing, amongst other things, 
            <br>some interesting square columns. There have been some archaeological digs in the area, dating back to the early 1950’s

                <p style="color: darkred"><b>Axum </b> </p>
        
                <p>
            <br>Axum is most famous for being one of the supposed sites of the Ark of the Covenant, in the care of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Supposed to have been 
            <br>brought to Ethiopia by the Queen of Sheba, it is currently in the care of the patriarch of the Ethiopian Church in a vault at the church of. St Mary 
            <br>of Zion.Other important sites within the city are the Stelae Park. Much excavated, the stelae are thought to mark graves. The site is considered 
            <br>important enough for it to have been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Other sites of interest include the Queen of Sheba’s bath and two 
            <br>Royal Palaces, on from the fourth century andone from the sixth century CE.

                <p>
            <br>Harar Jugol, also known simply as Harar, was an important 16th century capital and remains an important fortified historic town in Ethiopia. It served as a vital
            <br>trade route from the late 16th to 19th centuries and is also said to be the fourth holiest city of Islam.Today, Harar Jugol is a UNESCO World Heritage site, best
            <br>known for its distinctive and well preserved historic townhouses which reflect its cultural heritage, particularly those of African and Islamic traditions.
            <br> The most intact elements of the historic town of Harar Jugol are said to lie in the eastern and south-eastern part of the walled town. It is home to three 10th
            <br> century mosques and an impressive 82 mosques overall.
