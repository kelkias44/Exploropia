                <p>
        <br>Meskel, one of the major Ethiopian Orthodox festivals is celebrated for two days beginning September 26th. Legend has it that in the year 326, Queen Helena
        <br>(Empress Helen) the Mother of Constantine the Great, discovered the cross upon which Christ was crucified. Unable to find the Holy Sepulchre, she prayed
        <br>for help and was directed by the smoke from a burning fire as to where the cross was buried. After unearthing the Holy Cross, Queen Helena lit torches
        <br>heralding her success.  In the Middle Ages, the Patriarchof Alexandria gave the Ethiopian Emperor Dawit half of the True Cross in return for protection
        <br>afforded to the Coptic Christians. A fragment of the True Cross is reputedly heldat the Gishen Mariam, about 70 kilometers northwest of Dessie.
        <br>Ethiopians have been celebrating this day for millennium. There are two occasions on Meskel. The first is Demera (September 26), in which bonfires are
        <br>built topped by a cross to which flowers are tied. The flowers are Meskel Daisies.The Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church orchestrates the
        <br>lightening ceremony. After the bonfires are blessed they are lit and dancing and singing begins around them. Priestsin full ceremonial dress sing around
        <br>the bonfire.  Little Demera are also built at individual houses or villages. After some time, splinters from the bundles of burning wood collapse. Which
        <br>direction they fall is very significant: north, south, east or west Interpretations are soon conjectured as to whether the fields of grain are going to
        <br>be plentiful or not, or there is peace all year round, etc.  At the closing of the Demera, a rain shower is expected to fall to help put the fire out.
        <br>If the rain falls and the fire is extinguished, there is a belief that the year will be prosperous. The day after the Demera is Meskel. This day is
        <br>observed with plenty of food and drink as believers go to the spot of the Demera and, using ashes from the fire, mark their heads with the sign of
        <br>the cross. The festival coincides with the mass blooming of the golden yellow Meskel daisies. The best place to see the Meskel Festival is in the
        <br>capital Addis Ababa at the famous Meskel Square. But all along the Historic route (Bahir Dar, Gonder, Axum, and Lalibela) and in other major towns,
        <br>Meskel is colorfully celebrated.

                <p style="color: darkred"><b>Timket</b> </p>

                <p>
        <br>Celebrating the Baptism of Christ, every January 19th (January 20 during leap year), Timkat is the greatest colorful festival of Orthodox Christians in Ethiopia.
        <br>It celebrates the Baptism of Christ by John the Baptist.  The eve of Timket is called Ketera. This is when the Tabots of each church are carried out in
        <br>procession to a river or pool of water where the next day's celebration will take place. A special tent is set up where each Tabot rests as members of the
        <br>church choirs chant hymns. This is accompanied by a special dance by the priests with their prayer sticks and sistera, the beating of drums, ringing of bells,
        <br>and blowing of trumpets. The Tabot symbolizes the Ark of the Covenant and the tablets of the Law, which Moses received on Mount Sinai. It is the Tabot rather
        <br>than the church building, which is consecrated, and it is accorded extreme reverence. When the Tabot is carried out, it is wrapped in brocade or velvet
        <br>"like the mantle of Christ" and carried on the head of a priest with colorful ceremonial umbrellas shading it. The priests pray throughout the night and mass
        <br>is performed about 2:00 am the next day. Near dawn the people go to the water and attend the prayers. After the prayer, a senior priestuses a golden
        <br>processional cross to bless the water and extinguishes a burning consecrated candle in the water. Then he sprinkles the water on the assembled congregation
        <br>in commemoration of Christ's baptism.  Many of the more fervent leap fully dressed into the water to renew their vows. The Timkat ceremony is merely a
        <br>commemoration, not an annual rebaptism. After the baptism, the Tabots of each church, except St. Michael's church, start their way back to their respective
        <br>churches. The elders march solemnly, accompanied by singing, leaping priests and young men, the beating of staffs and prayer sticks recalling the ancient rites
        <br>of the Old Testament (11 Sam.Chap.6) The next day, 20 Jan, is the feast of Michael the Archangel, Ethiopia's most popular saint. And it is only on this morning
        <br>that the Tabot of St. Michael’s is returned to his church, also accompanied by the singing and dancing of priests and locals with their colorful dress.
        <br>Thus endsthe three-day celebration, a unique ceremony of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which evolved in relative isolation from the rest of the world.
        <br>The best place to attend the event is Lalibela, Gonder or Addis Ababa. In Addis Ababa many tents are pitched in the grassy field at Jan Meda, to the
        <br>northeast of the city center. At 2:00am a massis attended by crowds who've brought picnics to enjoy by the light of oil lamps. At dawn the priest extinguishes
        <br> a candle burning on a pole setin a nearby river using a ceremonial cross. Some in the congregation leap into the river. The Tabots are then taken back to
        <br>the Churches in procession,accompanied by horsemen, while the festivities continue.
